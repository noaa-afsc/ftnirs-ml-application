    "text": "The AFSC Age and Growth Program have pioneered machine learning methods to streamline specimen age predictions from otoliths. The approach is a multimodal convolutional neural network, (MM- CNN) as described in Benson et al. (2019), which encorporates two key data modalities: the entire range of wavenumbers of FT-NIR spectra, and corresponding biological and geospatial data.\nDuring development of this technique, scripts was developed in jupyter notebooks and demonstrated excellent performance in multiple species age prediction (cite). To bring these techniques to a wider audience, the code was refactored into functional programming. The core scripts were refactored into a functional programming codebase that encorporated ideas like data standards and the machine learning lifecycle to promote reuse and extention of the method across a broader range of data and machine learning techniques.\nThis codebase was developed in python, and currently supports the following features:\n\nFull machine learning lifecycle:\n\nTraining\nInference\nFine-tuning\n\nModel inference and fine-tuning will use the data given as best possible\n\nAutomatic interpolation of spectra as required\nNew data can be incorporated into fine tuning while preserving existing model weights\n\nBuilt in features for under-the-hood data formatting\n\nautomatic one hot encoding for known categorical variables\nawareness of standard variables to promote combining data where appropriate\n\n\nThe application serves to deliver the codebase core logic in an easy to use interface.",
